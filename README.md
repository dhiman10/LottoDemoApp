Architecture
MVVM + Service Layer Pattern
View Layer (SwiftUI)
    ↓
ViewModel Layer (Business Logic)
    ↓
Manager Layer (Coordination)
    ↓
Service Layer (Network/Data)
Key Components
View Layer (Core/LotteryScreen.swift)

Displays UI states: loading, content, error, empty
Handles user interactions
Accessibility identifiers for testing
ViewModel Layer (Core/LotteryViewModel.swift)

Uses @Observable macro for state management
Manages lottery data, loading states, and errors
Coordinates data fetching from manager
Derives UI state (isEmpty property)
Manager Layer (Services/Service/LotteryManager.swift)

Orchestrates service calls
Separates main and additional lottery fetching
Provides abstraction over service layer
Service Layer

Protocol: LotteryService - Defines service contract
Network Implementation: NetworkLotteryService - Real API calls
Mock Implementation: MockLotteryService - For testing and previews
Data Models (Model/LotteryResponse.swift)

LotteryResponse: Main lottery data model
LotteryDraw: Draw information
DrawResult: Numbers and results
Includes computed properties for display formatting
Requirements
iOS 17.0+
Xcode 15.0+
Swift 5.9+

Testing
Unit Tests
Located in LottoDemoAppUnitTestsApp/, covering:

LotteryViewModelTests (25+ tests)

Initial state validation
Successful data fetching
Error handling
Loading states
Spiel77/Super6 assignment logic
State transitions
Edge cases
Run all unit tests:

bash
Cmd + U
Key Test Cases:

testInitialState() - Validates initial ViewModel state
testFetchAllLotteries_Success() - Tests successful data loading
testFetchAllLotteries_Failure() - Tests error scenarios
testFetchAllLotteries_AssignsSpiel77AndSuper6To6aus49() - Tests supplementary lottery assignment
UI Tests
Located in LottoDemoAppUITestApp/, covering:

Test Scenarios

Loading State - Validates loading indicator appears
Empty State - Tests empty state UI
Error State - Tests error display and retry functionality
Content State - Validates lottery cards display correctly
Tap Interaction - Tests tap gesture handling
State Transitions - Tests flow between different states
Key UI Test Cases:

testLoadingState() - Verifies loading indicator
testEmptyState() - Validates empty state UI
testErrorState() - Tests error overlay and retry
testLotteryListDisplay() - Validates lottery cards
testLotteryCardElements() - Tests individual card elements
testSpiel77AndSuper6Display() - Tests supplementary numbers
Test Coverage
Unit Tests: ~90% code coverage for ViewModels and Managers
UI Tests: All major user flows covered
Mock Services: Complete mock implementations for testing
Widget Extension
Features
Small, Medium, and Large widget sizes
Displays latest lottery results
Shows jackpot amounts
Next draw dates
Auto-updates via Timeline
Implementation
Uses WidgetKit framework
Shares data models with main app
Timeline provider for automatic updates
Deep linking to main app
Technical Decisions
1. SwiftUI over UIKit
Modern declarative syntax
Less boilerplate code
Built-in state management with @Observable
Better preview support
2. MVVM Architecture
Clear separation of concerns
Testable business logic
Easy to mock for testing
Scalable for future features
3. Protocol-Oriented Service Layer
Enables easy mocking for tests
Supports different implementations (Network, Mock, UI Test)
Dependency injection friendly
4. Async/Await for Networking
Modern Swift concurrency
Cleaner than completion handlers
Better error handling
Structured concurrency with async let
5. @Observable Macro (iOS 17+)
Replaces @ObservableObject + @Published
Simpler syntax
Better performance
Automatic change tracking
6. Accessibility Identifiers
All interactive elements tagged
Enables robust UI testing
Follows Apple's accessibility guidelines
API Integration
Endpoints
swift
NetworkConstants.Endpoints.mainLotteries
// Returns: 6aus49, Eurojackpot with draw results

NetworkConstants.Endpoints.additionalLotteries  
// Returns: Spiel77, Super6 numbers
Data Flow
App launches → ViewModel calls fetchAllLotteries()
Manager fetches from both endpoints concurrently
ViewModel processes results, assigns Spiel77/Super6 to 6aus49
UI updates automatically via @Observable
Error Handling
Network errors caught and displayed to user
Retry functionality built-in
Graceful degradation if one endpoint fails
Known Limitations
Requires iOS 17+ (due to @Observable macro)
No offline functionality
Limited to German lotteries
No user authentication/personalization
Future Enhancements
Potential Improvements

Offline Support - Cache lottery results locally
User Preferences - Customize favorite lotteries
Notifications - Push notifications for draw results
Animations - Smooth transitions between states
Localization - Multi-language support
Analytics - Track user engagement
